History
jotai-history is a utility package for tracking state history in Jotai.

Installation
npm install jotai-history
withHistory
import { withHistory } from 'jotai-history'

const targetAtom = atom(0)
const limit = 2
const historyAtom = withHistory(targetAtom, limit)

function Component() {
const [current, previous] = useAtomValue(historyAtom)
...
}
Description
withHistory creates an atom that tracks the history of states for a given targetAtom. The most recent limit states are retained.

Action Symbols
RESET
Clears the entire history, removing all previous states (including the undo/redo stack).

import { RESET } from 'jotai-history'

...

function Component() {
const setHistoryAtom = useSetAtom(historyAtom)
...
setHistoryAtom(RESET)
}
UNDO and REDO
Moves the targetAtom backward or forward in its history.

import { REDO, UNDO } from 'jotai-history'

...

function Component() {
const setHistoryAtom = useSetAtom(historyAtom)
...
setHistoryAtom(UNDO)
setHistoryAtom(REDO)
}
Indicators
canUndo and canRedo
Booleans indicating whether undo or redo actions are currently possible. These can be used to disable buttons or conditionally trigger actions.

...

function Component() {
const history = useAtomValue(historyAtom)

return (
<>
<button disabled={!history.canUndo}>Undo</button>
<button disabled={!history.canRedo}>Redo</button>
</>
)
}

Memory Management
Because withHistory maintains a list of previous states, be mindful of memory usage by setting a reasonable limit. Applications that update state frequently can grow significantly in memory usage.
