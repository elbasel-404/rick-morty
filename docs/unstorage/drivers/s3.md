Store data to storage to S3-compatible providers.
S3 driver allows storing KV data to Amazon S3 or any other S3-compatible provider.

Driver implementation is lightweight and based on fetch working with Node.js as well as edge workers.

Usage

Setup
Setup a "Bucket" in your S3-compatible provider. You need this info:

Access Key ID

Endpoint
Region
Make sure to install required peer dependencies:

npm

yarn

pnpm

bun

deno

npm i aws4fetch
Then please make sure to set all driver's options:

import { createStorage } from "unstorage";
import s3Driver from "unstorage/drivers/s3";

const storage = createStorage({
driver: s3Driver({
accessKeyId: "", // Access Key ID
secretAccessKey: "", // Secret Access Key
endpoint: "",
bucket: "",
region: "",
}),
});
Options:

bulkDelete: Enabled by default to speedup clear() operation. Set to false if provider is not implementing DeleteObject.
